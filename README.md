# Cancer_Diagnosis_DNN_DNA_SEQ
DNA sequence classification with CNN 

Hi 

My name is shakila and its my very first code in Bioinformatic and DNN 
I know I'm not "professional" but just wanted to share this code with those who welcome new ideas

Here I'm using GRch37 seq and many datasets which contains mutations of my chosen genes (TP53,BRAF,BRCA2,LRP1B,PIK3CA,IDH1)
In this project, I used k_mers algorithm and tried to classify Breast, Brain, Skin, and Lung cancers through genome sequences

Just upload datasets and run the code !easily â˜º
