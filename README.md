# Cancer_Diagnosis_DNN_DNA_SEQ
DNA sequence classification with CNN 
Hi 
my name is shakila and its my very first code in Bioinformatic and DNN 
I know its not "professional" but just wanted to share for those who welcome new ideas

here im using GRch37 seq and many datasets which contains mutations in my chosen genes (TP53,BRAF,BRCA2,LRP1B,PIK3CA,IDH1) and also k_mers algorithm to classify Cancers(Lung Skin Breast Brain)

just upload datasets and run the code !easily â˜º
